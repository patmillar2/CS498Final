<h2 class="subtitle"><b>Hybrid Structure:</b> The structure chosen was the interactive slideshow. Accomplished with different tabs for each visual that can be clicked in order from left to right to tell the story.</h2>
<h2 class="subtitle"><b>Scenes:</b> There are two overview slides and a conclusion slide. The overview slides show the entire dataset of a specific piece of data used for the conclusion. The first two are laid out as bar graphs because I could not figure out how to set-up a geographical map in D3. To compensate for this, you can interact with each bar in the graph by mousing over it to display country information. The last slide is a slide that compares the data from the first and second graphs into a scatterplot to attempt to locate any trends in the data.</h2>
<h2 class="subtitle"><b>Annotations:</b> The graphs contain relevant axial data that is explained below for each one. Each slide has its own annotations based on the graphic present. The user can also mouse over any data piece to see what country it corresponds to.</h2>
<h2 class="subtitle"><b>Parameters:</b> The graphs can be switched between using the tabs at the top; this allows them to select which piece of data they wish to look at.</h2>
<h2 class="subtitle"><b>Triggers:</b> The buttons at the top of the page will redraw the canvas into whatever graph was selected from the tabs.
